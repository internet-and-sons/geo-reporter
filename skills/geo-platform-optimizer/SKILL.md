# GEO Platform Optimizer

## Core Insight

Only **11% of domains** are cited by BOTH ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews for the same query. Each AI search platform uses different indexes, ranking logic, and source preferences. A page optimized for Google AI Overviews may be invisible to ChatGPT, and vice versa. Platform-specific optimization is not optional — it is the foundation of any serious GEO strategy.

## How to Use This Skill

1. Collect the target URL and the site's primary topic/industry
2. Run each platform checklist below against the site
3. Score each platform on the 0-100 rubric
4. Generate GEO-PLATFORM-OPTIMIZATION.md with per-platform scores, gaps, and action items

## Platform 1: Google AI Overviews (AIO)

### How Google's AI surfaces select sources (2026)

AI-generated answers are now Google's default search surface globally (confirmed July 2026). Two facts changed the optimization model:

1. **Rank decoupling.** Only ~38% of AI Overview citations come from the Google top-10 (down from 76% in mid-2025); a #1 ranking gives roughly a 33% citation probability. "Rank first, get cited" no longer holds.
2. **Query fan-out.** One user query is decomposed into 8–15 parallel sub-queries; each sub-query retrieves *passages* independently. Pages ranking for fan-out sub-queries are ~161% more likely to be cited (0.77 correlation between fan-out rankings and citation).

### Fan-out coverage check (run this)

1. Take the page's head topic and enumerate its likely fan-out sub-queries: definition ("what is X"), mechanism ("how does X work"), comparison ("X vs Y"), cost/pricing, examples/best-of, requirements/how-to, recency ("X in 2026"), audience variants ("X for [segment]").
2. For each sub-query, check whether the page contains a self-contained passage (heading + 40–60 word direct answer) that could answer it alone.
3. Report coverage as N/M sub-queries covered, list the uncovered ones, and recommend covering them **on the same comprehensive page** — Google warns against page-per-variation sprawl.

### Optimization checklist

- Question-form H2/H3 headings matching fan-out sub-queries
- A 40–60 word direct answer immediately under each question heading
- Comparison tables (extractable) and definition patterns
- Machine-readable dates (`<time datetime>`, Article schema dateModified) — freshness is a measured citation signal (~half of cited pages <13 weeks old)
- Article/FAQPage schema where content genuinely matches the type

### Scoring Rubric (0-100)

| Criterion | Points | How to Score |
|---|---|---|
| Fan-out sub-query coverage (N/M covered) | 20 | 20 if 80%+ of sub-queries covered, 10 if 40-79%, 0 if under 40% |
| Question-based headings matching sub-queries | 10 | 2 points per question heading, max 10 |
| 40-60 word direct answers after headings | 15 | 3 points per direct answer, max 15 |
| Tables present for comparison data | 10 | 10 if tables used appropriately, 5 if partial, 0 if absent |
| Lists for processes/features | 10 | 10 if present, 5 if partial |
| FAQ section with 5+ questions | 10 | 10 if 5+, 5 if 1-4, 0 if none |
| Statistics with citations | 10 | 2 points per cited stat, max 10 |
| Machine-readable publication/updated dates | 5 | 5 if both dates machine-readable, 3 if one or visible-only, 0 if none |
| Author byline with credentials | 5 | 5 if full byline, 3 if name only, 0 if none |
| Clean URL + heading hierarchy | 5 | 5 if H1>H2>H3 clean, 3 if minor issues, 0 if broken |

## Platform 1b: Google AI Mode

AI Mode is the conversational search surface (multi-turn, zero blue links by default, "Deep Search" fan-outs that can exceed 100 sub-searches). Treat it as a distinct target from classic AIO:

- **Zero-click by design:** ~93% of AI Mode sessions end without a click. The win condition is being *cited and named*, not ranked — brand visibility inside the answer is the metric.
- **Optimization:** identical mechanics to the fan-out model above, plus entity strength (consistent Organization/Person schema with sameAs, third-party corroboration) so the brand is *named* even when not linked.
- **Measurement caveat:** report to clients that AI Mode traffic largely won't appear in analytics; branded-search impressions and direct traffic are the observable proxies.

## Platform notes: Grok and DeepSeek

- **Grok (xAI):** optimize via the open web + X/Twitter presence (Grok grounds heavily on X content). No reliable crawler identity — see geo-botaccess's unverifiable-bots note.
- **DeepSeek:** no published crawler identity; no platform-specific lever exists beyond general citability. Say so rather than inventing tactics.

## Platform 2: ChatGPT Web Search

### How ChatGPT Selects Sources
- Uses **Bing's search index** as its foundation (not Google)
- Top citation sources by domain share: **Wikipedia (47.9%)**, Reddit (11.3%), YouTube, major news outlets
- ChatGPT heavily weights **entity recognition** — if your brand exists as a structured entity (Wikipedia, Wikidata, Crunchbase), it is far more likely to be cited
- Prefers **authoritative, well-established sources** over new or niche sites
- Longer, more comprehensive articles get cited more often than short pieces
- ChatGPT tends to cite **the most canonical source** for a claim rather than the original

### Optimization Checklist

1. **Wikipedia Presence**: Check if the brand/person/product has a Wikipedia article. If not, assess notability criteria. If notable, create a draft. If an article exists, ensure it is accurate and current.
2. **Wikidata Entity**: Verify the entity exists on Wikidata (wikidata.org). If not, create a Wikidata item with key properties: instance of, official website, social media links, founding date, headquarters location.
3. **Bing Webmaster Tools**: Verify the site is registered in Bing Webmaster Tools. Submit sitemap. Check for crawl errors.
4. **Bing Index Coverage**: Use `site:domain.com` on Bing to verify key pages are indexed. Bing may have different indexed pages than Google.
5. **Reddit Authority**: Check for brand mentions on Reddit. Identify relevant subreddits. Assess whether the brand participates authentically in discussions.
6. **YouTube Presence**: Verify YouTube channel exists with relevant content. Video descriptions should contain full URLs and entity information.
7. **Authoritative Backlinks**: ChatGPT/Bing weight .edu, .gov, and major publication backlinks heavily. Audit backlink profile for these sources.
8. **Entity Consistency**: Brand name, founding date, leadership, and key facts must be consistent across Wikipedia, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, and the official website.
9. **Comprehensive Content**: Pages targeting ChatGPT citation should be **2000+ words** with thorough topic coverage. ChatGPT prefers single authoritative sources over combining multiple thin pages.
10. **Clear Attribution**: Include "About" sections, company descriptions, and founding stories. ChatGPT uses these for entity grounding.

### Scoring Rubric (0-100)

| Criterion | Points | How to Score |
|---|---|---|
| Wikipedia article exists and is accurate | 20 | 20 if exists, 10 if stub, 0 if none |
| Wikidata entity with 5+ properties | 10 | 10 if complete, 5 if basic, 0 if none |
| Bing index coverage of key pages | 10 | 10 if full, 5 if partial, 0 if poor |
| Reddit brand mentions (positive) | 10 | 10 if active discussions, 5 if mentions, 0 if none |
| YouTube channel with relevant content | 10 | 10 if active, 5 if present but sparse, 0 if none |
| Authoritative backlinks (.edu, .gov, press) | 15 | 3 points per authoritative backlink category, max 15 |
| Entity consistency across platforms | 10 | 10 if consistent, 5 if minor discrepancies, 0 if major |
| Content comprehensiveness (2000+ words) | 10 | 10 if thorough, 5 if adequate, 0 if thin |
| Bing Webmaster Tools configured | 5 | 5 if verified, 0 if not |

## Platform 3: Perplexity AI

### How Perplexity Selects Sources
- Top citation sources: **Reddit (46.7%)**, Wikipedia, YouTube, major publications
- Perplexity places the **heaviest emphasis on community validation** of all AI search platforms
- Strongly favors **discussion threads** where claims are debated, validated, or expanded by multiple participants
- Prefers recent content — publication date is a strong ranking signal
- Cites **multiple sources per answer** (typically 5-15), so there is more opportunity for mid-authority sites to appear
- Uses its own crawling infrastructure in addition to search APIs

### Optimization Checklist

1. **Active Reddit Presence**: The brand or its representatives should participate authentically in relevant subreddit discussions. Not promotional — helpful, specific, and community-oriented.
2. **Reddit AMAs and Threads**: Encourage or participate in AMAs, detailed discussion threads, and community Q&As. Perplexity treats these as high-signal content.
3. **Forum and Community Presence**: Beyond Reddit, check Hacker News, Stack Overflow, Quora, and niche industry forums. Perplexity indexes these heavily.
4. **Discussion-Friendly Content**: Publish content that invites discussion — opinion pieces, research findings, contrarian takes, original data. Content that gets shared and debated in communities ranks higher.
5. **Freshness Signals**: Publish content with clear dates. Update content regularly. Perplexity deprioritizes stale content more aggressively than other platforms.
6. **Multiple Source Validation**: Claims in your content should be supported by other sources. Perplexity cross-references and prefers claims it can verify from multiple origins.
7. **YouTube Video Content**: Create video content that Perplexity can reference. Ensure video titles, descriptions, and transcripts contain target information.
8. **Direct, Quotable Passages**: Write paragraphs that can stand alone as citations. Each paragraph should make one clear point with supporting evidence.
9. **Original Data and Research**: Publish original surveys, benchmarks, case studies, or datasets. Perplexity heavily favors primary sources.
10. **Perplexity Pages**: Check if Perplexity has created a "Page" about your topic/brand. These are curated summaries that influence future citations.

### Scoring Rubric (0-100)

| Criterion | Points | How to Score |
|---|---|---|
| Active Reddit presence in relevant subreddits | 20 | 20 if active contributor, 10 if mentioned, 0 if absent |
| Forum/community mentions (HN, SO, Quora) | 10 | 10 if multiple platforms, 5 if one, 0 if none |
| Content freshness (updated within 6 months) | 10 | 10 if recent, 5 if within year, 0 if older |
| Original research/data published | 15 | 15 if original research, 10 if case studies, 5 if some data, 0 if none |
| YouTube content with transcripts | 10 | 10 if active channel, 5 if some videos, 0 if none |
| Quotable, standalone paragraphs | 10 | 2 points per well-structured quotable paragraph, max 10 |
| Multi-source claim validation | 10 | 10 if claims well-sourced, 5 if some sourcing, 0 if none |
| Discussion-generating content | 10 | 10 if content gets shared/discussed, 5 if some engagement, 0 if none |
| Wikipedia/Wikidata presence | 5 | 5 if present, 0 if absent |

## Platform 4: Google Gemini

### How Gemini Selects Sources
- Uses **Google's search index** plus strong weighting toward **Google-owned properties**
- YouTube content is weighted significantly more heavily than in standard Google Search
- Google Business Profile data is directly accessible to Gemini
- Gemini uses Google's Knowledge Graph directly — entity presence in Knowledge Graph is a major advantage
- Structured data (Schema.org) is consumed directly by Gemini for entity understanding
- Gemini multi-modal: can reference images, videos, and text together
- Gemini models also power Google's AI Mode search surface — for that surface's fan-out and zero-click dynamics see **Platform 1b: Google AI Mode** above

### Optimization Checklist

1. **Google Knowledge Panel**: Check if the brand has a Google Knowledge Panel. If not, claim it through Google Business Profile or structured data. Ensure all information is accurate.
2. **Google Business Profile**: Complete and optimize GBP with all fields: hours, services, photos, posts, Q&A. Gemini pulls directly from GBP for local queries.
3. **YouTube Strategy**: Create YouTube content for every key topic. Optimize titles, descriptions, timestamps, and closed captions. Gemini cites YouTube more than any other AI platform.
4. **YouTube Chapters and Timestamps**: Use chapters (timestamps in description) so Gemini can reference specific segments of videos.
5. **Google Merchant Center**: For e-commerce, ensure products are in Google Merchant Center. Gemini references product data directly.
6. **Structured Data (Schema.org)**: Implement comprehensive Schema.org markup. Gemini uses this for entity understanding more aggressively than other platforms.
7. **Google Sites Ecosystem**: Ensure presence across Google ecosystem: Google Scholar (for research), Google News (for publishers), Google Maps (for local).
8. **Image Optimization**: Gemini is multi-modal. Use descriptive alt text, structured image filenames, and high-quality images. Include relevant images with every piece of content.
9. **Google E-E-A-T Signals**: All standard Google E-E-A-T signals apply with extra weight. Author pages, about pages, editorial policies, and expertise demonstrations.
10. **Chrome Web Store / Google Workspace Marketplace**: For software companies, presence on Google platforms adds entity signals.

### Scoring Rubric (0-100)

| Criterion | Points | How to Score |
|---|---|---|
| Google Knowledge Panel exists | 15 | 15 if complete, 10 if partial, 0 if none |
| Google Business Profile complete | 10 | 10 if fully optimized, 5 if basic, 0 if none |
| YouTube channel with topic-relevant content | 20 | 20 if active with chapters, 10 if present, 0 if none |
| Schema.org structured data implemented | 15 | 15 if comprehensive, 10 if basic, 5 if minimal, 0 if none |
| Google ecosystem presence (Scholar, News, Maps) | 10 | 10 if 3+, 5 if 1-2, 0 if none |
| Image optimization (alt text, filenames) | 10 | 10 if all images optimized, 5 if partial, 0 if none |
| E-E-A-T signals (author pages, about, editorial) | 10 | 10 if strong, 5 if partial, 0 if weak |
| Google Merchant Center (if e-commerce) | 5 | 5 if applicable and active, N/A otherwise |
| Multi-modal content (text + images + video) | 5 | 5 if rich multi-modal, 3 if some, 0 if text-only |

## Platform 5: Bing Copilot

### How Copilot Selects Sources
- Uses **Bing's search index** (shared infrastructure with ChatGPT but different ranking/selection)
- Supports **IndexNow protocol** for near-instant indexing of new and updated content
- Copilot tends to cite **fewer sources per answer** (typically 3-5) but gives more prominent attribution
- Microsoft ecosystem integration: LinkedIn, GitHub, Microsoft Learn content is weighted
- Copilot prefers pages with clear, structured markup and fast load times

### Optimization Checklist

1. **Bing Webmaster Tools**: Register and verify site. Submit XML sitemap. Review and fix any crawl issues.
2. **IndexNow Implementation**: Implement the IndexNow protocol to notify Bing of content changes in real-time. Submit a key file at `/.well-known/indexnow-key.txt` and ping the IndexNow API on content publish/update.
3. **LinkedIn Company Page**: Ensure the company LinkedIn page is complete with accurate description, employee connections, and regular posts. Copilot indexes LinkedIn content.
4. **GitHub Presence**: For tech companies, maintain an active GitHub presence. Copilot references GitHub repos, documentation, and README files.
5. **Microsoft Learn / Documentation**: If relevant, contribute to Microsoft Learn or ensure documentation is compatible with Microsoft's documentation standards.
6. **Bing Places for Business**: Equivalent to Google Business Profile. Complete all fields for local search visibility in Copilot.
7. **Clear Meta Descriptions**: Bing/Copilot weights meta descriptions more heavily than Google does. Write compelling, keyword-rich meta descriptions for every page.
8. **Social Signals**: Bing has historically weighted social signals (shares, likes, engagement) more than Google. Maintain active social media presence.
9. **Exact-Match Keywords**: Bing's algorithm is more literal about keyword matching than Google. Include exact target phrases in titles, headings, and body content.
10. **Fast Page Load**: Copilot deprioritizes slow pages. Target sub-2-second load time. Optimize images, enable compression, minimize render-blocking resources.

### Scoring Rubric (0-100)

| Criterion | Points | How to Score |
|---|---|---|
| Bing Webmaster Tools verified + sitemap | 15 | 15 if verified, 5 if partial, 0 if not |
